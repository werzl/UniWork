# University-Work
Assignments and coursework from my time at the University of Essex.



Software Engineering
This assignment looks at the project management side of development including gathering requirements through use-cases, mapping use-cases to users and drawing up class diagrams and sequence diagrams.






Data Structures and Algorithms
Exercise 1 - Created a PriorityQueue (like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it).

Exercise 2 - Added recursive methods to a Binary Search Tree to retrieve the ints held in the nodes.

Assignment 2 - Takes an expression and inputs it to an expression tree, solve it using pre-order traversal, and return the complete expression using in-order traversal.
