Software Engineering

This assignment looks at the project management side of development including gathering requirements through use-cases, mapping use-cases to users and drawing up class diagrams and sequence diagrams.




<br/>

Data Structures and Algorithms

Exercise 1 - Created a PriorityQueue (like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it).

Exercise 2 - Added recursive methods to a Binary Search Tree to retrieve the ints held in the nodes.

Assignment 2 - Takes an expression and inputs it to an expression tree, solve it using pre-order traversal, and return the complete expression using in-order traversal.

C++

ex1 - Scans through 2 specified text files to find students and attach marks to them. Each student is a separate Person object and then they are all added to a vector and displayed once the txt files have been processed.

ex2 - Iterates through the text of Hamlet and depending on user choice, finds all occurences of Upper case letters, digits, and punctuation.
