Data Structures and Algorithms

Exercise 1 - Created a PriorityQueue (like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it).

Exercise 2 - Added recursive methods to a Binary Search Tree to retrieve the ints held in the nodes.

Assignment 2 - Takes an expression and inputs it to an expression tree, solve it using pre-order traversal, and return the complete expression using in-order traversal.
