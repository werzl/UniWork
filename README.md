# University-Work
Assignments and coursework from my time at the University of Essex.




<br/>

Software Engineering

This assignment looks at the project management side of development including gathering requirements through use-cases, mapping use-cases to users and drawing up class diagrams and sequence diagrams.




<br/>

Data Structures and Algorithms

Exercise 1 - Created a PriorityQueue (like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it).

Exercise 2 - Added recursive methods to a Binary Search Tree to retrieve the ints held in the nodes.

Assignment 2 - Takes an expression and inputs it to an expression tree, solve it using pre-order traversal, and return the complete expression using in-order traversal.




<br/>

C++

ex1 - Scans through 2 specified text files to find students and attach marks to them. Each student is a separate Person object and then they are all added to a vector and displayed once the txt files have been processed.

ex2 - Iterates through the text of Hamlet and depending on user choice, finds all occurences of Upper case letters, digits, and punctuation.




<br/>

Information Retrieval

Ass1 -  Takes a URL as a single command-line argument. Returns a list of indexed strings from the web page’s plaintext.




<br/>

Natural Language Engineering

Assignment 1
Part1 - Tokenize and POS tag a string using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python.

Part2 - Connects to a URL, downloads the web-page and uses Regular Expressions to identify occurrences in the text where an amount of money is mentioned, displays each instance.

Part3 - A re-work of the famous ELIZA program, uses regular expressions and pattern matching to simulate a conversation between the user and the program.


Assignment 2 - Language model that calculates probabilities of words appearing using feature likelihood estimates and is trained using the Naive Bayes classifier.




<br/>

PHP

Some samples of PHP files from my final year project.

overview.php - Displays all of the modules the user is enrolled in, a bar chart showing all the modules against each other in the middle of the page and a required percentage to achieve each grade at the bottom of the page. All data is selected from the MySQL database hosted on an AWS endpoint. 

modules.php - A button is displayed for each module the user is enrolled in which opens a modal box containing a pie chart, range sliders and overall grade.
